======

This is the base controller node for the ARGO. It subscribes to the Joy node and publishes "cmd_vel_"(only Linear) under the topic /argo_base/cmd_vel. The code in the servo arduino listens to this topic and publishes servo code accordingly.

Update (31/10/2016):
======
1. All the brakeInfo was removed and argo_base_control only listens to the joy topic and publishes Servo commands under cmd_vel
2. A new launch file(argo_base.launch) calls both argo_servo and roboteq

TODO
====
1. The Joy namespace resolution needs to be checked.
